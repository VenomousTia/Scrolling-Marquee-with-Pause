<!-- Your 'marquee' class is the class you edit to cahnge the style of the marquee. 
This would be such as adding a border, how long it is, how tall it is, and other such .css styling -->
<div class="marquee">
  
  <!-- To account for how many images you have in your scroll, you edit the from-width, to-width, and time values. -->
  <!-- Usually, from-width sits at 0%, aka the start of the scroll, but you may want to change it if you have a very small or very large list of images. -->
  <!-- Your to-width, is what allows for a smooth scroll/repeat of images. 
    Since the scroll essentially jumps back to its originally position to restart its movement, you want to make that jump as small as possible, to trick the naked eye. -->
  <!-- The time is simply how fast it scrolls. -->
