# Scrolling Marquee with Pause when hovered
HTML, and CSS code for a marquee template, which can be customized individually, per instance.
This is intended for usage on [neocities](https://www.neocities.org), for creating a scroll feed of buttons. With minor changes, this could likely be used for anything else.

The code makes usage of inline css styling and variable values, to allow for the individualized customization. Perhaps in the future, something cleaner/easier to manage will be used.

## Plans:
* Refer to a folder for images in marquee, via javascript
* Get rid of inline styling, replaced with an alternative
* Future Unknown Changes
